# GeometricEye

This library developed for Autodesk Maya generates 3D ocular models using MRI data. The following are instructions for installation, usage, and expected inputs.

## Installation

1. Install a version of (Autodesk Maya)[https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya]. This library was developed on a Windows 10 machine using Autodesk Maya 2020. While other versions and operating systems may work, there is no guarentee. Specifically, Maya 2020 uses the Python 2.7 interpretor while newer versions use Python 3.0. This alone will create incompatability issues (although they can be resolved). If Maya 2020 cannot be installed on your machine, I suggest looking into the source code and modifying the elements with incompatabilities (this will likely be src/read_roi.py or src/parseInputPoints.py)
2.
